            <p class="history-text">
                The department was founded on February 19, 1970 under the name of the Department of Structural Studies. Its first manager was V.P. Roan. The department conducted crystallographic studies of new materials synthesized both in the department and at the Institute of General and Inorganic Chemistry of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (IZNH of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine). The main scientific direction of the department's work was the synthesis of metal hydroxides by precipitation from solutions, the study of their phase, chemical composition, crystal structure, the influence of deposition conditions and chemical composition on dispersion, aging, dissolution and other properties of samples. The technology for manufacturing ferromagnetic materials by the method of deposition from solutions was developed, which became the basis of the Dos ice production organization, where ultra-high-frequency (UHF) ferrites of various brands were manufactured and supplied to various organizations. At that time, there were only 2 organizations developing UHF ferrites in the former USSR: Research Institute "Domen" (Leningrad) and Experimental Production of IZNH NASU (Kyiv), which used the technology developed in the department. Starting from 1975, the list of classes of materials studied in the department expanded. Since August 15, 1975, the name of the unit has also changed, namely the Department of Solid Phase Synthesis and Crystal Chemistry of Inorganic Compounds.<br />From May 11, 1982, the department was headed by A.G. Belous. The subject matter of the department was again significantly expanded, and from February 16, 1993, the department received a modern name - the Department of Solid State Chemistry. The department continued the existing research of ferromagnetic materials and created new areas of research, in particular, high-frequency dielectrics and the development of dielectric resonators and substrates based on them for hybrid UHF circuits; ferroelectrics-semiconductors with a positive temperature coefficient of resistance and the development of heating elements based on them for diesel engines, which allowed them to be started at low temperatures; ionic (Li, Na, Rb, Cs, O) solid electrolytes for fuel cells and solid-state batteries; nanosized particles of ferromagnetic materials for hyperthermia inducers. Dielectric elements, which were developed in the department, were manufactured at the Experimental Production and supplied to customers in various branches of production.<br />Now the department is one of the leading scientific teams in Ukraine in the field of solid state chemistry. The work of the department is widely known in the world. The team of the department won and successfully implemented 16 projects with foreign funding. Employees have repeatedly participated in international conferences with plenary, oral and invited reports. The scientific works of the department's employees are widely cited in the international scientometric databases Web of Science, Scopus. The department first synthesized lithium-conductive materials with a perovskite structure; developed composite high-quality microwave dielectrics and products based on them (dielectric resonators and substrates for hybrid microwave circuits) for modern communication systems; developed materials and thermostable heating elements for starting diesel engines at low temperatures; multilayer systems in which the magnetic properties change under the influence of an electric field. 17 candidates of sciences have been trained, who are successfully working both in Ukraine and abroad, in particular, in Switzerland, Japan, Germany, the USA, Spain, France.
